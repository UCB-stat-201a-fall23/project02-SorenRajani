## Stat 201A - Project No2

...

## Deliverables

Before the date of the first midterm, your personal repository `student-<username>` should include the contents inside the notebook `Project02-CLT.ipynb`. It is ok if this notebook is repeated across repositories of students working in the same group, but it is important that each student has its own repository with the notebooks for the projects. You will find the list of thing to do for this first project inside the Jupyter Notebook. 

## Contribution statement

Collaboration is encouraged between students. However, each student will have to submit its own set of solutions in their own repository. At the end of each notebook, you have to add the list of all the people you worked with.
